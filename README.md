# Android Architecture Components

A collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps. Start with classes for managing your UI component lifecycle and handling data persistence.


Data Binding - Declaratively bind observable data to UI elements.

Lifecycles - Create a UI that automatically responds to lifecycle events.

LiveData - Build data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.

Navigation - Handle everything needed for in-app navigation.

Room - Access your app's SQLite database with in-app objects and compile-time checks.

ViewModel - Store UI-related data that isn't destroyed on app rotations. Easily schedule asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.

WorkManager - Manage your Android background jobs.
